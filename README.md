# gitlet
Designed and coded miniature version of the local version-control system Git.  Contains core functionalities of Git such as init, add, commit, checkout, rm, log, find, status, branch, rm-branch, reset, and merge.  Implements serialization to create "save files" for file and version history.

 All code besides the Utils.Java file (that defines serialization functions) is original.
